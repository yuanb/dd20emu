# dd20emu

This project is dedicated to create an Arduino UNO based Laser-200/310 DD20/DI40 Floppy drive interface and drive emulator.
Since at the moment this project is created, I only have a Laser-200 on hand, which has relative less amount of RAM (6K) on board. The design will include 16K (6264 SRAMX2) memory expansion as well.

Todo list:
* Collect documents regarding DD20 interface and Disk image format.
*
