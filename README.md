# dd20emu

This project is dedicated to create an Arduino UNO based Laser-200/310 DD20/DI40 Floppy drive interface and drive emulator.
Since at the moment this project is created, I only have a Laser-200 on hand, which has relative less amount of RAM (6K) on board. The design will include 16K (6264 SRAMX2) memory expansion as well.

Devices I have:
* Laser 200, Basic version 1.1, 6KB RAM.
* Laser 310, Basic 2.0, 16K RAM.
* 64K RAM extension cartridge for Laser 310. 

Todo list:
* Collect documents regarding DD20 interface and Disk image format.
* Design a 16K SRAM extension card to Laser 200
* I have about 2.25 hours length of Laser 310 data tape. They are Demo, Utilities, Games, Basic program I wrote etc. I would like to convert them to vz files. Giving they are 30 years old, the recorder I used back then was not a standard data recorder, there is only a little hope. [This link](http://www.pagetable.com/?p=32) describes how data tape encoding works on Apple I.
